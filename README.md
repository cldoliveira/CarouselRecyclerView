# Carousel Recycler View
 

In this repository,  I'm going to demonstrate how to use the recycle view snap effect.
A snap effect looks like google play app behavior.

I'm going to demonstrate how to resize the centralized view as well.
We can use this when we want to focus on some element of a set.


A good example would be a selection of available credit cards or some selection you'd like.
